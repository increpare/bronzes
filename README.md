# Figures in Bronzes 

I'm going to go through various figures that appear in early chinese bronze vessels, as listed in Consten's and Deydier's books.  As an exercise to keep me entertained as I went through, I redrew many of the figures in a pixel-art style as I went.  I initially was just working from photographs and rubbings, but when I tried to go through a list of kinds of figures I just went with the illustrations in the paper provided - often I couldn't find a photo/rubbing of the original.

## Demons

Animal-style motives that aren't portrayal of actual animals, but composites of different animal features and stylized animals, above all t'ao t'ieh + dragons.

* Taotie (饕餮) 'glutton'
  * "The term t'ao-t'ieh denotes mask-like animal faces in frontal view, which lie flat on the surface of the vessel" (Consten)
  * The Annals of Lü Buwei, 16/1.5 (~240BC) described as:
    * 周鼎著饕餮，有首無身，食人未咽，害及其身，以言報更也。為不善亦然。
    * The tripods of Zhou are decorated with the Taotie.  It has a head but no body. It devours people, but since it can never swallow them, its actions bring harm to itself. [Koblock/Riegel].
  * Sheng'an Ji - Yang Shen (~1500AD):
    * 饕餮，好飲食，故立於鼎蓋
    * Taotie, likes to eat and drink, used to appear on the surface of dings (bronze vessels). [Wikipedia]
  * Both Karlgren and Consten dislike this term, because they don't believe the explanations talk about what the figures represent:
    * "This somewhat unfortunate term, foolishly introduced by the Sung time archaeologists, is so current in literature about Chinese bronzes that we had better maintain it." - Karlgren
    * Deydier: "According to an ancient Chinese myth, a being called taotie 饕餮 was the son of the God Jinyun 神人縉雲氏. A good-for-nothing, fear-inspiring, avaricious and gluttonous creature, taotie 饕餮 had an insatiable appetite for human beings. He eventually became so gluttonous that he was unable to digest all that he devoured, until one day a human victim got caught in his throat and he choked, with the result that his lower body gradually disappeared, leaving only his big greedy face, a fierce reminder to all of the ill, self-harming effects of avarice, gluttony and wastefulness."

  * Some Taotie are composed of two mirrored animals, left and right, like the following chameleon-like creatures:

  * Some cannot be decomposed into left/right halves:

  * Here's one that has limbs, but not composed of left/right animals:
